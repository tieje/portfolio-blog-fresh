# About Me

TL:DR; I'm looking for job.

&emsp; "I was born in the year ...

&emsp; ... and that's how I helped usher in a new golden age."

- I graduated in 2018 on full scholarship with a B.S. in Chemistry from UCONN where I was awarded the Roland Award (1 of 2 recipients) from the Chem department for an outstanding senior thesis.
- There aren't really many Chemistry jobs near me so I'm transitioning into full stack web development. If I did research on the best major to choose in college instead of winging it and if I knew earlier that my biological Dad's work was in programming, I would have chosen software engineering instead.
- It's been tough. But I've been through much worse in life.
- Somehow, I'm getting married in the Fall of this year (2022).
- I need a job. I've been looking, but as they say in tech, "Your hardest job to get in tech will be your first."
