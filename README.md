# portfolio-blog-fresh
I chose to build my new portfolio and blog with the [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) framework with the [Deno](https://deno.land/) runtime because I'd like to keep up with the Deno runtime as well as [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

## Architecture

- Web Framework: [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/)
    - JS library: [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
    - runtime: [Deno](https://deno.land/)
    - styling: [Twind](https://twind.dev/) (basically TailwindCSS)
    - animation: [Animxyz](https://animxyz.com/)
    - server-side Markdown processing: [deno-gfm](https://github.com/lucacasonato/deno-gfm)
- Deployment: [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)
