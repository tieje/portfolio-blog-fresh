# portfolio-blog-fresh
I chose to build my new portfolio and blog with the [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) framework with the [Deno](https://deno.land/) runtime because I'd like to keep up with the Deno runtime as well as [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

## Architecture

- Web Framework: [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/)
    - JS library: [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
    - runtime: [Deno](https://deno.land/)
    - styling: [Twind](https://twind.dev/) (basically TailwindCSS)
    - animation: [Animxyz](https://animxyz.com/)
    - server-side Markdown processing: [deno-gfm](https://github.com/lucacasonato/deno-gfm)
- Deployment: [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)

## Changelog

11/24/2022

I have decided to only use this site as a portfolio site.
The scope of this site was too big.
Building a front page and creating a better static site generator are major pain points that I'd rather solve with other technologies than to build it myself.
The new blog site can be found [here](https://tieje.github.io/) and its repo can be found [here](https://github.com/tieje/tieje.github.io).
